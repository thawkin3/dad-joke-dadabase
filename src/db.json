While Pascal runs off and hides, Newton takes out some chalk and marks a square on the ground with a side length of exactly 1 meter, then sits down inside the square. When Einstein is finished counting and sees Newton sitting on the ground, he yells, \"Ha, I've found you, Newton!\". Newton however replies, \"No you haven't! You've found one Newton over a square meter. You've found Pascal!"
